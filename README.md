convert Mirakurun channels JSON to m3u8 list

## What's this?
Currently, [Mirakurun](https://github.com/Chinachu/Mirakurun) has supported IPTV from ver 3.7.0. While on the older version of Mirakurun with some reasons like Node dependencies, IPTV clients such as VLC require m3u8 playlists. `channels_list_conv` creates the m3u8 playlist file automatically from Mirakurun API's channels list.

## Usage
```bash
$ python channels_list_conv.py
```
